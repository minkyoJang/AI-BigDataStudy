### R code and data files from Hadley's "tidy data" presentation

`tidy-data.R` contains the **R code**, commented and minimally modified, from the first 30 minutes of the [video of Hadley Wickham's presentation](http://vimeo.com/33727555) about tidy data and tidy tools.

The presentation is based on a [paper he wrote](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf), and the slides in the video are similar to [slides he used when teaching a class](http://stat405.had.co.nz/lectures/18-tidy-data.pdf) at Rice University. The data files referenced in the presentation are currently available on the [class website](http://stat405.had.co.nz/). For convenience, I have included the **paper**, **class slides**, and **data files** in this repo.

#### Important notes:

 * The R code contains the "Billboard" example that can be found in the paper and class slides, but is not shown in the video.
 * Besides some trivial modifications, I did modify the code to use functions from the dplyr package instead of plyr. [dplyr is the next iteration of plyr](http://blog.rstudio.org/2014/01/17/introducing-dplyr/), focused on data frames, and is under [active development](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr).
 * All of the packages used in the R code can be installed from CRAN.
 * I welcome any comments, corrections, or questions!
